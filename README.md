# Openshift Prometheus Metrics Selector
## Description

Custom Prometheus exporter for Openshift, used for collecting only a subset of important metrics. You can configure jobs or namespace as source of metrics (useful for take only node-exporter, openshift-state-metrics or etcd metrics).
I used it for integrate Prometheus stack installed on Openshift 4.10 with Datadog without add annotations on exporters and containers across the cluster (usually controlled by operators)

Prometheus Stack on Openshift exposes tons of metrics. All are important, but what are definitely significants?
Sometime too many metrics and alerts can confuse SysOps teams. There is not clarity of what is important for a first-level monitoring system.
## Use Case - DataDog Openmetrics Integration

![dd_usecase](images/datadog.svg)
## Prerequisites

1. OCP_pms must be installed into the project openshift-monitoring for found automatically required secrets (for TLS cert client)
2. Put a token (Base64 encoded) of a ServiceAccount into the secret secret-ocp-metrics-selector located into the manifests folder. This account in my case is admin of the project openshift-monitoring but I am sure that we can create a custom role with no admin grants but just the required grants...

## Installation

```bash
oc create -f manifests/dc-ocp-metrics-selector.yaml

# Change token of your sevice account that can be authenticated to the internale Openshift Prometheus
oc create -f manifests/secret-ocp-metrics-selector.yaml

# Change url and regex for your needs
oc create configmap ocp-metrics-selector-cm --from-file=metrics_selector.ini -n metrics-selector
```
## Configuration Example
```bash
[prometheus]
url = https://prometheus.local
jobs = node-exporter,prometheus-k8s,openshift-state-metrics
namespaces = openshift-etcd
```
## ConfigMap Example
```bash
apiVersion: v1
data:
  metrics_selector.ini: |
    [prometheus]
    url = https://prometheus.local
    jobs = node-exporter,openshift-state-metrics
    namespaces = openshift-etcd
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ocp-metrics-selector-cm
  namespace: metrics-selector
```
